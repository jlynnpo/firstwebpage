          <h2> About Me </h2>
          <p> I began my journey in software development as a website designer creating Wordpress websites for family
            and friends. I have always been interested in entrepreneurship and small businesses, so I was passionate
            about creating digital assets that would help small businesses succeed. </p>

          <p> I love everything that is digital marketing. Since becoming a software developer I have gained an in-depth
            knowledge about the digital assets that I create for clients. </p>

          <p>

            I am always eager to discuss new projects and help clients reach their goals. If you’re looking for a
            developer for your new project, let’s chat! </p>
